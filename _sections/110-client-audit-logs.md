### Introduction

This specification is a sub-specification of the [ODK XForms Specification](./). It describes the structure of client audit logs which a form definition can request using the `orx:audit` element as listed in [the metadata section](./#metadata).

### CSV format
Audit log CSVs generated by clients must:
- use UTF-8 character encoding
- use commas as separators
- use NIX line endings (`\n`)
- escape values with commas or newlines by wrapping the value in double quotes (`"`)
- escape double quotes by prepending another double quote only if a value containing commas or newlines also contains double quotes
- include a single header row including some or all of the column names described below

### Header column names
All audit log CSVs generated by clients must include a header row. That header row must define the following columns:
- `event`: an identifier for the event being tracked (see Events section for valid identifiers)
- `node`: for events that refer to a specific node, the XPath path of that node
- `start`: a timestamp represented as the number of milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC
- `end`: for events that have an end time, a timestamp represented as the number of milliseconds since midnight, January 1, 1970 UTC

If location tracking is configured by the form definition (see [audit attributes](./#audit-attributes)), audit log CSVs generated by clients must define the following additional columns:
- `latitude`
- `longitude`
- `accuracy`

If change tracking is configured by the form definition (see [audit attributes](./#audit-attributes)), audit log CSVs generated by clients must define the following additional columns:
- `old-value`: the value of the `node` at time of the `event` `start`
- `new-value`: the value of the `node` at time of the `event` `end`

### Events
Currently, ODK Collect is the only client known to implement this sub-specification. Supported events are listed [in its user-facing documentation](https://docs.opendatakit.org/form-audit-log/#event-types). As additional clients implement audit logging, standard and client-specific events will be listed here.
